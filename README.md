# Datafiles JSON : A JSON file-based ORM for Python dataclasses

This is a remix of Datafiles to try and make it work in Circuit Python


Datafiles is a bidirectional serialization library for Python [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) to synchronize objects to the filesystem using type annotations. It supports a variety of file formats with round-trip preservation of formatting and comments, where possible. Object changes are automatically saved to disk and only include the minimum data needed to restore each object.

## Documentation

To see additional synchronization and formatting options, please consult the [full documentation](https://datafiles.readthedocs.io).
